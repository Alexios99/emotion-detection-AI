aboutHome = """Emotion AI, also known as affective computing, is essentially all about detecting emotions using artificial intelligence. Machines with this kind of emotional intelligence are able to understand not only the cognitive but also the emotive channels of human communication. That enables them to detect, interpret, and respond appropriately to both verbal and nonverbal signals.

In the research field, a lot of work is being put into imparting an emotional understanding to machines. Machine learning and deep learning are especially relevant in this respect. With these technologies, images and speech recognition systems are used as input for the machines. In this way, the machines learn how to recognize and interpret a smile or change in tone of voice, for example: Is it a happy or sad smile? Does it make the current situation better or worse than before? However, researchers are also working with parameters such as skin temperature and heart rate, which, among other things, are practical for developing wearables that are as smart as possible.

The enormous potential of emotion AI
Emotions have an enormous influence on our behavior. That can also – and in fact especially – be seen along the customer journey from a marketing perspective. When customers have positive emotional associations with a brand, they are much more likely to be loyal to it than if the evoked associations are detached or even negative. Therefore, if brands want to improve the customer experience, they need a system that doesn’t work on the basis of purely rational intelligence, but is also able to: learn from every interaction, understand both the cognitive and emotive pathway of human communication,
sense intention and distinguish between literal and non-literal statements.
In short: marketers need emotion AI."""
